## How to add a PoC's repository?

In order to add a PoC to this repo, please follow these steps:

1. Add a folder and `README.md` for the PoC, `README.md` may contain PoC's _**description**_, and _**resources**_ (look at [DataProfiling](DataProfiling/) for example).
2. Inside the new folder, create subfolders named: documentation (_compulsory_), src (_optional_), and others if necessary.
3. Get back to [PoC list along with resources](#PoC-list-along-with-resources) and add your new PoC to the list.
